# Task-4-Internship
# Product Filter Java Program

This Java program reads a list of products from a CSV file (`products.csv`), filters out the products whose price is greater than **1000**, and writes them to a new CSV file called `expensive_products.csv`.

## 📋 Features

- Reads products from `products.csv`.
- Each product entry contains a `name` and a `price`.
- Filters products with `price > 1000`.
- Writes the filtered results to `expensive_products.csv`.
- Displays a success message and prints the filtered products.

## 📁 Files

- `products.csv`: Input CSV file containing sample product data (auto-created by the program).
- `expensive_products.csv`: Output file containing products with price > 1000.
